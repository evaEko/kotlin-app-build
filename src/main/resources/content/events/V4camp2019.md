Young V4 climbers trained together with the support of Visegrad Fund

More than 80 athletes and coaches from Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia joined V4 Youth Olympic Climbing Camp 2019 for four days from Feb 15 to Feb 18 in La Skala, Žilina. 
These young climbers selected by national climbing associations (the project partners) took part in training and competition simulation of all three climbing disciplines. 
Bouldering, lead and speed climbing. In this combination of disciplines the sport climbing enters the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, historically for the first time. 
The camp was organized by Climbing Academy from Modra (SVK) and was financially supported by Visegrad Fund. 

Young athletes enjoyed the event. Eliška Adamovská, the promising Czech climber, commented the event in social media: “Thank you for the opportunity to train all the three climbing disciplines. I’m also very happy that I could spend these intensive days with many talented and passionate climbers who always keep the motivation high.”

Thank you for coming and contributing to the nice V4 camp atmosphere.
And if you did not have the chance to come, train hard and soon you will. 
We already hope for a next one.
