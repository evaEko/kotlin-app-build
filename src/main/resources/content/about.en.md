# About Us

We are one of the most successful climbing teams in Slovakia. We focus on developing child and youth sport climbing skills: we organize climbing training sessions and competitions for youngsters in the largest climbing gyms in Slovakia, Vertigo and K2. We also organise training and summer camps and climbing courses for children and adults.

For funding, we rely on our members, parents of the children, donations of 2% tax, the town of Modra and the companies Eurokim and Yak&Rysy.

We would be very happy if you decide to join us and help support sport and sport climbing in Slovakia.
