# Gradle Build with Kotlin Application

The build.gradle script creates a runnable jar with dependencies from kotlin source.

//THIS WORKS if you run
// to include forms:
// ./gradlew buildPage;
// ./gradlew copyForms;
// ./gradlew runFinalJar
// to exclude forms:
// ./gradlew buildPage;
// manually remove forms from target/forms
// make sure the sk/index.html en/index.html
//dont contain any links to forms.
